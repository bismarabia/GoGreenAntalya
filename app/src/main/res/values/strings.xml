For some people the concept of going green is a lifestyle adjusment that encompasses every aspect of a personâ€™s lifestyle. To someone looking in at this lifestyle, the concept of why someone should go green may seem odd. All an outsider may see is someone who recycles, carpools and chooses to buy organic food. The truth is the option to go green has several reasons and benefits that may not be outwardly apparent.</string>
